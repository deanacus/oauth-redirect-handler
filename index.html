          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a tool to simplify the process of copying and pasting
            redirect query params when you're working with an API that uses the
            OAuth authorization code flow, but don't have a front end running.
          </p>
          <h2>How do I use it</h2>
          <p>
            Just include the URL of the page as a redirect url for your
            application in the dashboard for whichever API you're using, and
            pass it along when initiaiting the authorization request as the
            redirect url, and when you follow the link, you will end up on the
            page with each query param separated out on the page ready to
            copy/paste into your server side code.
          </p>
          <h3>Note:</h3>
          <p>
            This is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a replacement for standing up
            your own front end to handle these values properly, just an early
            stage development helper.
